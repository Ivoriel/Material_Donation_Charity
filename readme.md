Basic internet portal project.

Goal of the portal is to allow passing information about donations to the relevant institutions, so they can pick them up.

The first functionality is for the user to be able to create a donation specifying the institution
to which they wish to donate (out of a list of serviced institutions), the donation info (what is donated
and in what amounts) as well as pick-up address and time info.
